**Text 1: Figure Skating Overview**  
Every morning before school, I head to the local ice rink in Virginia to practice figure skating. Figure skating is a graceful and athletic sport performed on ice. Skaters train for hours each day to master jumps like the axel, salchow, and toe loop. Skaters also wear custom costumes and rely on strong blades, boots, and music to bring their routines to life. At the Winter Olympics 2022 in Beijing, skaters competed under intense pressure to perfect their performances. Figure skating isn‚Äôt just about technique ‚Äî it‚Äôs about telling a story on ice, whether it's during a local competition in Chicago or on the World Championship.

*Possible Patterns to Create:*  
- Label `JUMPS`, Pattern: axel, salchow, toe loop  
- Label `GEAR`, Pattern: blades, boots, costumes

**Text 2: Exploring New York City**  
Living in New York City means there's always something exciting happening around every corner. Last weekend, I visited the Empire State Building with my cousin who had never been to the city before. We walked through Central Park, passed through Harlem, and browsed art galleries in SoHo. Later, we took the subway downtown, grabbed pizza from a local spot in the East Village, and ended the night with a visit to the Museum of Modern Art. I love how each neighborhood has its own character‚Äîfrom the historic charm of Greenwich Village to the towering lights of Times Square. It‚Äôs no wonder people say New York is the city that never sleeps!

*Possible Patterns to Create:*  
- Label `LANDMARKS`, Pattern: Empire State Building, Central Park, Museum of Modern Art, Times Square  
- Label `NEIGHBORHOODS`, Pattern: Harlem, SoHo, East Village, Greenwich Village
