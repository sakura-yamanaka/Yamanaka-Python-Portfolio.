## Project Overview 
This project focuses on building a **Customaizable Named Entity Recognition (NER) App**. The goal was to create an interactive app that allows users to upload or input their own text data, define custom entity patterns, and view highlighted entities in the output. 

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying specific pieces of information in text—such as names of people, organizations, dates, locations, and monetary values.

This app uses **spaCy's NER pipeline**, allowing users to experiment with both pre-trained models and user-defined entity patterns. 

### This project provides an interactive interface to:
- Explore spaCy’s pre-trained NER model (en_core_web_sm)
- Add custom patterns using EntityRuler (define custom entity recognition rules using label and pattern)
- Visualize entity spans and their types

Together, these features give users the ability to analyze text with a high degree of flexibility, customization, and precision.
