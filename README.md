# Yamanaka-Python-Portfolio.

This portfolio includes all my past and present Python projects that I have completed during the Elements of Computing II course. The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey in Python programming, problem-solving, and data anlysis and showcase my skills and knowledge to potential employers, collaborators, and peers. Feel free to look around!
