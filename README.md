# Yamanaka-Python-Portfolio.

This portfolio includes all my past and present Python projects that I have completed during the Elements of Computing II course. The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey in Python programming, problem-solving, and data anlysis and showcase my skills and knowledge to potential employers, collaborators, and peers. 

# My Projects: 

## [Interactive Named Entity Recognition (NER) App](NERStreamlitApp) :pencil:
**Description**: 

**How It Complements My Portfolio**: 

This project demonstrates my ability to:

## [Tidy Data Project: Mutant Moneyball](TidyData-Project) :books:
**Description**: 

This project focuses on cleaning and tidying the Mutant Moneyball dataset, which contains X-Men comic book value data from 1963 to 1993. The goal was to transform a wide, untidy dataset into a tidy format, making it easier to analyze and visualize. 

**How It Complements My Portfolio**: 

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply **tidy data principles** to restructure datasets for better analysis.
- Use **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- Create insightful visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- Communicate data insights effectively through clear documentation and visualizations.

## [Tallahassee Homes Explorer](basic_streamlit_app) :house_with_garden:
**Description**: 

The **Tallahassee Homes Explorer** is a basic Streamlit app designed to help users find their perfect home in Tallahassee. Key features include:
- **Personalized Search**: Users can filter homes based on zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and price.
- **Alternative Suggestions**: The app provides suggestions for similar homes in different zip codes, price ranges, or square footage to expand options.
- **User-Friendly Experience**

**How It Complements My Portfolio**:

This project showcases my ability to:
- Build a basic website app using **Streamlit**.
- Work with real-world datasets to solve practical problems.
- Implement user-friendly interfaces for data exploration.
