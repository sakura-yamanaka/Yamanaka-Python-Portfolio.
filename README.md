# Yamanaka-Python-Portfolio.

This portfolio includes all my past and present Python projects that I have completed during the Elements of Computing II course. The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey in Python programming, problem-solving, and data anlysis and showcase my skills and knowledge to potential employers, collaborators, and peers. 

# My Projects At A Glance: 

## [Political News Article Sentiment Comparison Tool](Streamlit-App-Final) :newspaper:

**Description**: 
This project focuses on building a Political News Article Sentiment Comparison Tool—an interactive app that lets users input or upload news articles via URL or .txt file to analyze and compare sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and generate word clouds of frequently used terms. As a Political Science major interested in polarization, media, and public opinion, I designed this tool in response to increasing polarization and the blurred line between fact and opinion, offering a data-driven way to critically evaluate political content and promote more balanced, informed engagement with the news.

**How It Complements My Portfolio**: 

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Create a **domain-specific app** that solves a problem in the Political field 
- Integrate **Python and Streamlit** with NLP techniques like **TextBlob for sentiment analysis**
- Perform **web scraping** with requests and BeautifulSoup
- Implement a **user-friendly interface** that allows users to compare articles easily with visualization tools like **matplotlib and WordCloud** and comprehsive user feedback

## [Interactive Named Entity Recognition (NER) App](NER-Streamlit-App) :pencil:
**Description**: 
This project focuses on building a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) application. The goal was to create an interactive app that allows users to upload their own text data, define custom entity patterns, and view highlighted entities in the output. 

**How It Complements My Portfolio**: 

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Leverage **spaCy’s EntityRuler** to implement customizable NER
- Integrate **Python, spaCy, and Streamlit** 
- Implement a **user-friendly interface** that allows users to upload text data, define custom entity labels and patterns, and visualize detected entities
- Deploy web applications to **Streamlit Community Cloud**

## [Tidy Data Project: Mutant Moneyball](Tidy-Data-Project) :books:
**Description**: 

This project focuses on cleaning and tidying the Mutant Moneyball dataset, which contains X-Men comic book value data from 1963 to 1993. The goal was to transform a wide, untidy dataset into a tidy format, making it easier to analyze and visualize. 

**How It Complements My Portfolio**: 

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply **tidy data principles** to restructure datasets for better analysis.
- Use **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- Create insightful visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- Communicate data insights effectively through clear documentation and visualizations.

## [Tallahassee Homes Explorer](Basic-Streamlit-App) :house_with_garden:
**Description**: 

The **Tallahassee Homes Explorer** is a basic Streamlit app designed to help users find their perfect home in Tallahassee. Key features include:
- **Personalized Search**: Users can filter homes based on zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and price.
- **Alternative Suggestions**: The app provides suggestions for similar homes in different zip codes, price ranges, or square footage to expand options.
- **User-Friendly Experience**

**How It Complements My Portfolio**:

This project showcases my ability to:
- Build a basic website app using **Streamlit**.
- Work with real-world datasets to solve practical problems.
- Implement user-friendly interfaces for data exploration.
